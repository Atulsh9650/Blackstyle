//i started making this website by first creating logo for my website i named it blackstyle to added dark colors to website to match it as well

1.header
i used two headers for first part of header 
in firstheader i used bootstrap to create row and col to make it responsive i added search bar and icons from font-awesome 
like search icon and cart icon and also added login button and some hover effects on button in second header i used collapse property frombootstrap
when screen size gets small firstheader hides and second header displayed on when clicked it showed hiiden items inside it.

2.footer
in footer i used display grid property to divide div in 4 equal colums and when screen size gets smaller i used media query as weel
to fit them in single column

3.index.html
after header and footer i created home page in which i added header and footer by using javascrpt dom wwhen dom gets load it automatically adds 
header and footer to every page .we just have to include two div with unique id in every page to add header and footer.
after that i created cover-image and added logo and slogan inside of coverimage and used position method to centre the logo and slogan
then i created featured section in which i used three sections in first four card displayed and in second 2 cards and in third 1 card
i used d-block d-none property for diiferent featured sections acc to need then i added carausel so when user click on prev and next they
can see every image
